This is an Smart contract that I develop as a solution to a Technical challenge for a Job in a Defi Mexican Startup.

I get the requirements of the challenge and base on that requirements I design the architecture of the Project, the functions and functionality the smart contract should have and after that I started the development of the project.

To develop this project I used the TDD(Test Driven Development) methodology, I created the tests first and created the code need it to pass the tests in a Iterative way, I also developed the optimal code thinking in gas optimization and security.
